# 🗃️ Cachito

**Cachito** is a collection of ready-to-use, thread-safe cache algorithms for Go with customizable handlers and metadata support. 
Built with simplicity and extensibility in mind.

## ✨ Features

- 🔒 **Thread-safe** implementations
- 🎯 **Customizable handlers** for insert, delete, access, and eviction events
- 📊 **User-defined metadata** accessible in all handlers
- 🚀 **Zero external dependencies**
- 🧩 **Generic types** support (Go 1.18+)
- 📝 **Comprehensive examples** for each algorithm

## 🎯 Supported Algorithms

| Algorithm                            | Status     | Description                            |
|--------------------------------------|------------|----------------------------------------|
| **LRU** (Least Recently Used)        | ✅ Complete | Evicts least recently accessed items   |
| **LFU** (Least Frequently Used)      | 🚧 Planned | Evicts least frequently accessed items |
| **FIFO** (First In, First Out)       | 📋 Planned | Evicts oldest items first              |
| **LIFO** (Last In, First Out)        | 📋 Planned | Evicts newest items first              |
| **TTL** (Time To Live)               | 📋 Planned | Time-based expiration                  |
| **ARC** (Adaptive Replacement Cache) | 📋 Planned | Self-tuning between LRU and LFU        |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
go get github.com/achetronic/cachito
```

## 📚 Examples

Detailed examples for each algorithm can be found in the `/examples` directory:

- 📁 `/examples/lru/` - LRU cache examples
    - `based-on-count.go` - Size-based eviction
    - `based-on-disk.go`  - Disk-based eviction
- 📁 `/examples/lfu/` - LFU cache examples (planned)
- 📁 `/examples/ttl/` - TTL cache examples (planned)

## 🎛️ Handler System

Cachito allows you to hook into different cache operations:

### Available Handlers

Handlers are user-defined functions that are triggered in different moments. Some data are passed to those functions.
Do you need some examples?

| Handler       | Trigger                      | Use Cases                    |
|---------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| `OnInsert`    | When a new entry is created  | Logging, metrics, validation |
| `OnDelete`    | When an entry is removed     | Cleanup, notifications       |
| `OnAccess`    | When an entry is accessed    | Analytics, usage tracking    |
| `ShouldEvict` | Before insertion (if needed) | Custom eviction logic        |
